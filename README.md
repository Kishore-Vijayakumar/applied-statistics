# Applied Statistics Project ðŸ“Š

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) created as part of an academic learning project on applied statistics. The project is divided into three sections, focusing on problem-solving, analytical objectives, and deriving insights from data.

## Project Overview
1. **Question-Based Analysis**  
   - Answered a set of statistical questions using data analysis techniques.  
   - Explored and visualized the dataset to derive meaningful insights.  

2. **Objective 1: Team Performance Analysis**  
   - Objective: Evaluate team performance in a competitive league to identify potential teams for investment by Company X.  
   - Key Steps:  
     - Analyzed team statistics and historical performance metrics.  
     - Identified teams not under competitor contracts.  
     - Provided recommendations for potential investments based on data-driven insights.  

3. **Objective 2: Company Data Analysis**  
   - Objective: Analyze company-level data to extract insights and address specific tasks.  
   - Key Steps:  
     - Explored the dataset attributes, plotted distributions, and performed hypothesis testing.  
     - Drew conclusions from statistical analysis to support strategic decision-making.  

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and ensured dataset readiness for analysis.  
- **Visualizations:** Used matplotlib, seaborn, and other libraries to create insightful plots and graphs.  
- **Statistical Techniques:** Applied hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression models to address objectives.  
- **Actionable Insights:** Recommendations based on comprehensive data-driven analysis.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive Python environment for statistical exploration and analysis.

## How to Run
